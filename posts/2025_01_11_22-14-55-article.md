# Cody AI Integration Guide

## Introduction
This guide explains how to integrate Cody AI with your code editor and make the most of its features. Cody AI is a powerful coding assistant that enhances your development workflow with AI-powered capabilities.

## Supported Editor Environments

Cody AI primarily supports VS Code and the full suite of JetBrains IDEs. Plugins for Emacs and Neovim are currently under development. Regardless of the editor choice, Cody's core functionalities remain consistent across platforms.

## Core Features After Integration

Once integrated into your editor, Cody provides chat functionality for code understanding and analysis. It can:
- Answer questions about code
