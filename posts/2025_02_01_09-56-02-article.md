## **Core Technological Innovations**

### **1. Knowledge Distillation Architecture**

- **Teacher Model Selection**: DeepSeek-R1, likely with billions of parameters, serves as the teacher model. Its mathematical reasoning abilities have been validated through benchmarks like MATH.
  
- **Distillation Strategy**:
  - **Output Layer Distillation**: The student model mimics the prediction distribution of the teacher model, preserving generalization for solving math problems.
  - **Intermediate Layer Alignment**: Through Attention Transfer, the student model learns feature representations from the teacher's intermediate layers, enhancing logical reasoning.
  - **Progressive Distillation**: The model is compressed in stages, first reducing the number of layers, then the width of each layer, to prevent a sharp drop in accuracy.

### **2. Mixed Precision Quantization (Q4_KM/Q5_KM)**

- **Quantization Scheme**:
  - **Block Quantization**: Weights are divided into blocks for independent calibration, reducing precision loss.
  - **Mixed Bit Width**: Critical layers like attention heads retain higher precision (Q5_KM), while others use Q4_KM, balancing compression with performance.

- **Results**: The model's size is reduced to 1.12-1.30GB, with memory usage during inference dropping from 3.2GB in FP16 to 1.8GB.

### **3. NPU-Specific Optimizations**

- **Compute-Memory Decoupling**:
  - Memory-intensive operations like LayerNorm use low-precision caching to minimize data transfer overhead.
  - Compute-intensive tasks like matrix multiplication leverage NPU's INT8/INT4 acceleration instructions.

- **Latency Optimization**: The first token generation time is reduced to 130ms from 230ms in FP16, making it suitable for real-time interactions.

## **Key Technologies for Mobile Adaptation**

### **1. Dynamic Shape Adaptation**

- **Adaptive Computation Graph**: Adjusts input sequence length based on screen resolution, such as truncating padding in portrait mode to reduce unnecessary computations.
- **Memory Pool Reuse**: Pre-allocates memory pools of various sizes to avoid frequent memory allocation/deallocation, boosting throughput to 16 tokens/s.

### **2. Power Management**

- **Power Wall Strategy**: Adjusts model parallelism based on remaining battery life, e.g., limiting NPU frequency at low battery to keep power consumption below 5W.
- **Sparse Inference**: Skips calculations on non-critical intermediate results, achieving an 18% reduction in power consumption.
