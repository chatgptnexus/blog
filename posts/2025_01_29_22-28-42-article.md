## Core Workflow Architecture

### 1. Intelligence Blueprint
```prompt
[Task Name: Global Tech Pulse]
Trigger: Daily 7 AM EST
Execution Protocol:
1. Search "AI breakthroughs" + "peer-reviewed" + site:.edu/.gov (past 18h)
2. Curate 5 top stories from: Nature, IEEE Spectrum, VentureBeat
3. Structure each entry with:
   - Impact-driven headline
   - Technical summary (under 100 words)
   - Source verification markers
   - Actionable implication analysis
```

### 2. Cognitive Enhancement Layer
```prompt
For each story:
1. Generate headline using Fogg Behavior Model principles
   Example: "MIT's New Chip Design Cuts AI Energy Use 60% - How This Lowers Your Cloud Costs"
   
2. Create three-section analysis:
   [Disruption Index] 1-10 scale measuring field impact
   [Timeline] Adoption phases: Lab ‚Üí Industry ‚Üí Consumer
   [Personal Leverage] Practical ways to benefit
```

## Quality Control Systems

### A. Source Validation Protocol
```prompt
For each collected story:
1. Check author credentials against IEEE/ACM databases
2. Verify institutional funding sources
3. Cross-reference experimental data with 2 preprint papers
4. Flag conflicts of interest with üîç
```

### B. Cognitive Load Optimization
```prompt
Before final output:
1. Convert technical jargon to Flesch-Kincaid Grade 8 equivalents
2. Insert 3 interactive elements per report:
   - Prediction market: "Bet on adoption timeline"
   - Skill adjacency matrix: "Your existing skills ‚Üí New opportunities"
   - Risk calculator: "Job impact probability"
```

## Advanced Personalization

### 1. Adaptive Relevance Engine
```prompt
When user engages with "quantum computing" content:
1. Activate sub-task: Track 3 quantum startups' funding rounds
2. Generate comparison matrix: D-Wave vs IBM vs Rigetti
3. Insert career transition roadmap
```

### 2. Ethical Filter Layer
```prompt
For military/controversial applications:
1. Apply Asilomar AI Principles checklist
2. Include dual-perspective analysis
3. Add resource section: "Ethical AI Organizations to Support"
```
