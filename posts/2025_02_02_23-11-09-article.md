# Advanced MCP Server Configuration with Parameters in cursor

In the world of AI, where precision is as vital as a sharp hook on a fishing line, configuring Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers with parameters can be straightforward. Here's how to do it, keeping things simple, like a clear day's dialogue.

## Brave Search with API Key

For Brave Search, which requires an API key, the setup is like setting the course on a calm sea:

- **Type**: `command`
- **Server**: 
```bash
env BRAVE_API_KEY=your-api-key -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search
```

This line sets your API key as an environment variable, then launches the Brave Search server with it, like giving directions to a trusted crew member.

## SQLite with Database Path

SQLite configurations are similar, only needing the path to your database:

- **Type**: `command`
- **Server**: 
```bash
uvx mcp-server-sqlite --db-path ~/Documents/sqlite-db/foo.db
```

Here, `uvx` is the command to run, followed by the SQLite server, with `--db-path` specifying where your database lives, as simple as pointing to a star in the night sky.

## Filesystem Access

For filesystem operations, the path to your directory is all you need:

- **Type**: `command`
- **Server**: 
```bash
npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem ~/Desktop
```

This command uses `npx` to start the filesystem server, directing it to your Desktop, like choosing the best spot to cast your line.

## Extending to Other Services

The pattern holds for other services or custom MCP servers. Here's how you might configure another hypothetical service:

### Hypothetical Weather Service with API Token

- **Type**: `command`
- **Server**: 
```bash
env WEATHER_API_TOKEN=your-token -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-weather ~/WeatherData
```

This configuration sets an environment variable for the API token and directs the server to a local directory, ensuring your AI can fetch weather data as easily as checking the wind.
