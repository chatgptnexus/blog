# ChatGPT Now Features Advanced Task Scheduling

In a significant update to its services, OpenAI has introduced a new beta feature to ChatGPT, allowing users to schedule tasks in advance. This development was first announced on January 14, 2025, through a post on X by OpenAI, revealing the rollout of this feature to Plus, Pro, and Teams users with intentions to extend it to all ChatGPT account holders in the future.

## What Does the Tasks Feature in ChatGPT Do?

The tasks feature empowers ChatGPT with the ability to generate content or send reminders at specified times. Users can set up to 10 tasks during the beta phase, which can include preset reminders like "Department meeting" or dynamic content like daily affirmations or news summaries. This functionality was highlighted in the X post where OpenAI suggested uses like weekly global news briefings or daily personalized workouts, showcasing the versatility of this new tool.

## How to Set Up a Task or Reminder in ChatGPT

Currently, this feature is exclusive to ChatGPT subscribers on Plus, Team, or Pro plans. To utilize it, users must select “4o with scheduled tasks” in the model picker. Task setup can be done across various platforms including web, desktop, and mobile applications, but the management of these tasks is confined to the web browser interface. Here, users can input natural language prompts to define their tasks, with date and recurrence settings available through a traditional dropdown menu.

This rollout was confirmed by OpenAI on X, indicating their plan to eventually make the feature available to all user tiers, including free accounts. The X post provided by OpenAI serves as a direct announcement of this feature's availability:

## OpenAI's Move Toward Agentic AI

The introduction of tasks in ChatGPT is a stride towards what is being termed as "agentic" AI, where AI tools autonomously execute complex actions by chaining multiple prompts. This positions ChatGPT's task feature in direct competition with established tools like Google Calendar, Apple's Siri, or Amazon Alexa, but with the added advantage of generative AI capabilities. For instance, setting a daily affirmation at 7 AM exemplifies how ChatGPT can blend reminder services with content creation.

While this feature mirrors functionalities of traditional calendar or to-do list applications, the generative aspect brings unique challenges, such as potential inaccuracies or misunderstandings, which are less of a concern with conventional tools. Furthermore, the energy consumption for AI-driven tasks is higher than for standard reminder applications, posing sustainability questions.

In parallel, major tech players like Google and Microsoft are also evolving their AI offerings, with Microsoft integrating agents based on OpenAI’s GPT-4o into Microsoft 365, and Google enhancing Google Workspace with AI features like Gemini Advanced.

## Conclusion

OpenAI's latest update to ChatGPT, allowing for the scheduling of tasks, marks a pivotal shift towards integrating AI into daily productivity tools. This feature not only enhances user engagement by personalizing interactions but also sets the stage for broader AI agent capabilities. As this feature moves from beta to general availability, it will be interesting to observe its impact on user productivity and the broader AI landscape.
