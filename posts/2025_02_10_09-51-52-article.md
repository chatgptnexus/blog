# How to Completely Uninstall Docker from Mac

Uninstalling Docker from a Mac involves removing the application itself and all associated files. Here are three effective methods to ensure a thorough cleanup:

## Method 1: Use Docker's Built-in Uninstaller

**Recommended for simplicity:**

1. **Open Docker Desktop**: Click the üê≥ icon in the menu bar, navigate to **Troubleshoot ‚Üí Uninstall**.
   - **Confirm the Uninstall** by clicking **Uninstall**.
   
   Alternatively, you can use the terminal:
   
   ```bash
   /Applications/Docker.app/Contents/MacOS/uninstall
   ```
   - If you get a `Permission denied` error, prepend `sudo` and enter your password.

## Method 2: Manual Removal

**For those who prefer a hands-on approach:**

### Step 1: Stop Docker Processes
- Quit Docker Desktop.
- Open **Activity Monitor** and force-quit any Docker-related processes (`Docker`, `com.docker`, `com.electron.docker-frontend`).

### Step 2: Delete Docker Application
- Drag **Docker.app** from `/Applications` to Trash.

### Step 3: Remove Residual Files
- Use the following Terminal commands to clean up Docker's residual files:

```bash
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/bin/docker* \
  ~/.docker \
  ~/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker \
  ~/Library/Group\ Containers/group.com.docker \
  ~/Library/Application\ Support/Docker\ Desktop \
  /usr/local/lib/docker \
  ~/Library/Caches/Docker\ Desktop \
  ~/Library/Preferences/com.docker.docker.plist \
  ~/Library/Saved\ Application\ State/com.electron.docker-frontend.savedState
```

### Step 4: Clear Docker Data (Optional)
- Permanently remove containers, images, and volumes:

```bash
docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)  # Containers
docker rmi -f $(docker images -q)  # Images
docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -q)  # Volumes
```

**Note**: This will delete all your Docker data irreversibly.

## Method 3: Third-Party Uninstallers

**For users who want an automated solution:**

- Use tools like **AppCleaner** or **BuhoCleaner**:
  1. Download and launch the uninstaller.
  2. Select Docker for removal.
  3. Empty Trash to complete the uninstallation.

## Post-Uninstallation Steps

- **Restart your Mac** to ensure all changes are applied.
- If some files remain, consider granting **Full Disk Access** to Terminal in **System Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security**.

## Troubleshooting

- **Permission Issues**: Use `sudo` with commands or adjust permissions.
- **Unresponsive Docker**: Use Activity Monitor to force-quit Docker processes.

By following these steps, you'll remove Docker completely from your Mac, leaving no trace behind. If you decide to reinstall, head over to [Docker‚Äôs official site](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) for the latest version.
