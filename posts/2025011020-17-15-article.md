# How to Save and Open PDFs in Files App with Shortcuts: Specify Path and Filename for Better Access

When using Shortcuts on iOS to print content to PDF, ensuring that the file is saved to a specific path with a designated filename can significantly improve file management. This method also ensures that the PDF file appears in the **Files App's "Recent Projects"** section, making it easier to locate and access later. Here’s how to set it up:

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 2. Configure the Shortcut to Save PDFs

#### Step 1: Receive Shared Content
- Add the **"Get Shared Items"** action.
- This action allows the shortcut to receive content (e.g., a webpage or file) shared via the iOS Share Sheet.

#### Step 2: Generate a PDF
- Add the **"Make PDF"** action.
- This converts the shared content into a PDF file.

#### Step 3: Save to a Specific Path
1. Add the **"Save File"** action.
2. Configure the path:
   - Select **"Shortcut Folder"** or a specific folder within iCloud Drive where the PDF should be saved.
3. Set the filename:
   - Enable **"Ask Where to Save"** to specify the file name dynamically each time.
   - Alternatively, add a **"Text"** action before saving to dynamically generate a file name (e.g., including the current date).

#### Step 4: Open the File
- Add the **"Open File"** action.
- This ensures that the saved PDF is immediately opened in the Files App, which automatically adds it to the **"Recent Projects"** list.

## Complete Shortcut Workflow

Here’s a summary of the Shortcut’s actions:

1. **Get Shared Items**: Receives content from the Share Sheet.
2. **Make PDF**: Converts the shared content to a PDF.

## Why Open the File After Saving?

Opening the file immediately after saving ensures that iOS recognizes it as a "recently opened" document. This makes it appear in the **Files App's "Recent Projects"** list, providing quick access without navigating through folders.

## How to Use the Shortcut

1. In any app that supports the Share Sheet (e.g., Safari, Files), tap the **Share** button.
2. Select the **"Print to PDF"** shortcut you created.
3. Enter the filename (if prompted) and confirm the path.
4. The shortcut will save the PDF and open it in Files App.

## Additional Tips

- **Custom Folder for PDFs**: Create a dedicated folder in Files App (e.g., `ShortcutsPDF/`) to store all PDFs generated by this shortcut.
- **Dynamic Filenames**: Use the **"Text"** action to add dynamic elements like the current date, time, or other identifiers to filenames for better organization.
