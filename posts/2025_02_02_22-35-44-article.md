# Integrating Filesystem with Model Context Protocol in cursor: A Developer's Guide

In the vast ocean of artificial intelligence, where data flows like currents, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) emerges as a beacon, guiding AI systems to interact seamlessly with the physical world of files and directories. This guide, inspired by the clarity of Hemingway, will navigate you through setting up a filesystem MCP server, a task as straightforward as a clear day in Key West.

## Introduction to MCP

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a revolutionary standard, like the first light of dawn, illuminating the path for AI assistants to connect with the systems where our data lives. Introduced in late 2024, MCP promises to simplify the integration of AI with various platforms, from local files to cloud services.

## Setting Up Filesystem MCP Server

### Step 1: Claude's MCP Configuration

In Claude, setting up the filesystem MCP server is as simple as writing a note. Here's how it looks:

```json
"filesystem": {
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/Users/hogehoge/Desktop"]
}
```

This JSON snippet is the map. It tells Claude to use `npx` to launch the `@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem` server, directing it to the user's Desktop, like pointing to a spot on a fishing boat.

### Step 2: Cursor's Configuration

For Cursor, the setup changes slightly, but the goal remains the same - to connect with the filesystem MCP server. Here's the configuration:

- **Name**: `filesystem`
- **Type**: `command`
- **Server URL**: `npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem /Users/foo/Desktop`

Cursor requires these details to be entered, like listing the essentials for a day's adventure. This configuration allows Cursor to interact with the filesystem through the MCP, a bridge from digital to physical.

### Step 3: Verification

After setting up, a green light should shine, clear as a signal fire, indicating success. This light is the confirmation that the filesystem MCP server is now operational, ready to serve as the AI's eyes and hands in the file system.

## Notes on Redundancy

It's worth noting, like a fisherman noting the weather, that Cursor inherently supports shell commands. Therefore, for Cursor users, this setup might seem like preparing for a storm when the sea is calm. Yet, for consistency across platforms and for those new to the sea of AI, this setup is a guidepost.

## Conclusion

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is not just a tool; it's a new chapter in AI's story, written in straightforward, powerful prose. By setting up a filesystem MCP server, developers can ensure that AI systems navigate the digital landscape with the precision of a seasoned mariner, enhancing productivity and integration.
