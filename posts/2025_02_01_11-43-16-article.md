# Building an Intelligent Document Assistant System with Gemini 2.0 Flash and Agno Framework

In the ever-evolving landscape of AI, the integration of multimodal AI models with advanced retrieval techniques has led to the creation of innovative systems like the Intelligent Document Assistant. This system, built on the Gemini 2.0 Flash model and the Agno framework, dynamically blends document and web information to provide precise, efficient question-answering services. Here, we delve into the technical architecture of this sophisticated system.

## System Architecture Overview

The architecture of the Intelligent Document Assistant is designed in three layers, harnessing cutting-edge AI technologies and database solutions:

### Frontend Layer: The Interaction Hub

We leverage the **Reflex framework** to build a responsive web interface, ensuring a seamless user experience across devices:

```python
# Example of a Reflex component
def chat_interface():
    return rx.box(
        rx.heading("Intelligent Document Assistant"),
        rx.input(placeholder="Enter your question...", on_change=State.set_question),
        rx.button("Ask", on_click=State.process_query)
    )
```

- **Core Features**:
  - Drag and drop document uploads with real-time preview (supporting PDF/Word formats)
  - Multi-turn conversation interface
  - Answer source tracking (annotations for document sections/web sources)

### Core Processing Layer: The Intelligent Hub

#### 1. Agent System

Integration with the **Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental** model brings advanced capabilities:

- **Multimodal Processing**: Handles mixed text/image inputs for nuanced analysis.
- **Dynamic Tool Invocation**:
  - `DuckDuckGoSearch` for web retrieval
  - `PythonREPL` for mathematical computations
  - Custom function calls via JSON schema

Here's how you might configure an Agno Agent:

```python
# Configuration example for an Agno Agent
agent = Agent(
    llm=Gemini2Flash(model="gemini-2.0-flash-exp"),
    tools=[DuckDuckGoSearchTool(), DocumentSearchTool()],
    memory=PostgresMemory(pool_size=20)
)
```

#### 2. Knowledge Management System

This system streamlines document processing:

1. **agno.document**:
   - PDF parsing using libraries like PyMuPDF or PDFplumber
   - Semantic chunking with a sliding window and title recognition algorithms
2. **agno.embedder**: 
   - Generates 768-dimensional vectors with GeminiEmbedder
3. **agno.knowledge**:
   - Vector storage optimized with PgVector indexing
   - Hybrid retrieval using BM25 and cosine similarity

#### 3. Memory System

- **Session Storage**: Uses PostgreSQL's JSONB fields to store conversation history.
- **Persistent Memory**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE agent_memory (
    session_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    context_vector VECTOR(768),
    metadata JSONB
);
```

### Storage Layer: The Data Hub

| Component | Technology | Features |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| Vector Database | PgVector | - Supports IVF indexing<br>- Up to 16K dimensions |
| Relational Database | PostgreSQL 15 | - Memory optimization (shared_buffers=4GB)<br>- Session management |
| Caching System | Redis 7 | - Caching hot questions<br>- Storing vector search results |
| File Storage | MinIO | - Document version control<br>- Management of temporary file lifecycles |

## Key Technological Innovations

### Dynamic Search Switching Mechanism

1. **Intent Recognition**: Gemini 2.0 Flash identifies the type of query in real-time.
2. **Hybrid Retrieval Process**:

```mermaid
graph TD
    User Query --> Intent Analysis
    Intent Analysis -->|Document Related| Vector Search
    Intent Analysis -->|Time-Sensitive| Web Search
    Vector Search --> Result Fusion
    Web Search --> Result Fusion
    Result Fusion --> Final Answer
```

### Long Document Handling Optimization

- **Chunking Strategy**: Adjusts the window size dynamically (300-1500 tokens).
- **Context Management**:

```python
def chunk_document(text):
    chunks = []
    for para in text.split('\n'):
        if len(para) > 500:
            chunks.extend(split_by_sentence(para))
        else:
            chunks.append(para)
    return chunks
```

### Performance Optimization Strategies

1. **Multi-Tier Caching**:
   - Level 1: Redis for hot QA (hit rate 85%+)
   - Level 2: PostgreSQL in-memory tables
2. **Parallel Processing**:

```python
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=8) as executor:
    doc_search = executor.submit(vector_search, query)
    web_search = executor.submit(duckduckgo_search, query)
    results = await asyncio.gather(doc_search, web_search)
```

## System Advantages

1. **Response Speed**: With Gemini 2.0 Flash, the system achieves a response time that's twice as fast as its predecessor [35][43].
2. **Accuracy Improvement**: The Agentic RAG approach increases answer accuracy by 37.5% over traditional methods [15][55].
3. **Multilingual Support**: Integration with Gemini 2.0's native TTS supports voice interactions in 11 languages [35][43].
4. **Extensibility**: The Agno framework allows for quick integration of new tools/data sources [7][37].

This architecture, combining the advanced reasoning capabilities of Gemini 2.0 Flash with the flexible extensibility of the Agno framework, marks three significant innovations in the field of document-based intelligent Q&A: dynamic search switching, efficient long document handling, and multi-source information fusion verification.
